# Architecture

The service keeps pure primitives separate from HTTP and MCP handlers:

- `envelope.py` and `errors.py` define the stable response contract.
- `auth/pat.py` issues high-entropy PATs and stores only HMAC-SHA-256 digests.
- `upload/` validates bytes before any persistence and strips image metadata by re-encoding.
- `rendering/` writes generated PNGs through a content-addressed `ImageStore`.
- `retrieval/` ranks local template records using typed filters, term overlap, and name boosts.

Postgres/pgvector and S3 are deliberate v1.5 stubs. Factories should reject those backends at
startup until their bodies and parity tests exist.
