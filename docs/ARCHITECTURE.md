# Architecture

The service keeps pure primitives separate from HTTP and MCP handlers:

- `envelope.py` and `errors.py` define the stable response contract.
- `auth/pat.py` issues high-entropy PATs and stores only HMAC-SHA-256 digests.
- `upload/` validates bytes before any persistence and strips image metadata by re-encoding.
- `rendering/` writes generated PNGs through a content-addressed `ImageStore`.
- `retrieval/` ranks local template records using typed filters, term overlap, and name boosts.
- `db/uploads.py` enforces a 24h TTL on pending uploads; pre-TTL databases are migrated on first
  connection via an idempotent `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` and stale rows are expired immediately.
- `db/vectors.py` exposes `EmbeddingMetaStore`, which records the embedding model used for each
  template's vector. `embeddings.client.validate_embedding_model` runs at app boot and refuses to
  start if any persisted vector disagrees with `EMBEDDING_MODEL`, or if any vector lacks a model
  record (the "orphan vector" case from pre-guard installs).
- `db/engine.py` exposes `sqlite_path(database_url, fallback)` — the single source of truth for
  resolving a `sqlite+aiosqlite:///...` URL to a concrete `Path`. All CLI entrypoints and the app
  factory share this helper.
- `corpus/upstream.py` imports the full `jacebrowning/memegen` template library from a local
  clone. `project_slot_position` maps each upstream text box (anchor_x/y, scale_x/y, align, angle)
  to a canonical 9-band position string (`top|bottom|center|top-left|...|middle-right`) and
  always carries the raw `box` dict so the renderer can reproduce memegen's layout decisions.
  Narrow, off-axis, or rotated boxes additionally retain a `position_override` mapping for
  external callers that already inspect it. `import_upstream_corpus` persists templates and
  returns a manifest of `slug -> SHA-256(image bytes)` pinned to the upstream commit, which
  `cli/seed.py` writes to `assets/memegen-seed-manifest.json` for reproducible seeding.
- `rendering/` reads each slot's `box` to derive pixel anchor, alignment, and box dimensions
  (see `_slot_anchor` in `rendering/pipeline.py`). `text_layout.select_wrap` picks the 1/2/3-line
  layout that fills ≥60% of box width while maximizing font size, and `fit_font` runs a
  shrink-loop to find the largest Anton size that fits the box with memegen-matching margins.
  Slots persisted without a `box` (legacy 3-band callers) fall back to synthetic top/center/bottom
  geometry via `_legacy_box_from_position`. Slot rotation (`box.angle`) is persisted but not
  applied at render time; reproducing rotated layouts is deferred past v1.

## Request authentication

Two auth surfaces share one tree:

- Web (`/browse`, `/auth/*`, `/api/templates`, `/renders/*` via session) uses GitHub OAuth with
  PKCE (S256) and a re-validated allowlist on every request. The token exchange targets
  `https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token` and the user-profile fetch targets
  `https://api.github.com/user` — two distinct hosts, not a shared `base_url` client.
- MCP (`/mcp` and `/api/mcp/*`) uses a static PAT in `Authorization: Bearer …`. Verification is
  HMAC-SHA-256 with a server-side pepper.

The MCP tool wrappers derive the rate-limit actor from the validated `AccessToken` via
`mcp.server.auth.middleware.auth_context.get_access_token()` — never from
`Context.client_id`, which is client-supplied request metadata and therefore spoofable. Tool
calls without a verified access token raise `UNAUTHORIZED` at the wrapper before any backend
work runs.

## Storage backends

Postgres/pgvector and S3 are deliberate v1.5 stubs. Factories reject those backends at startup
until their bodies and parity tests exist. See `docs/MIGRATION.md` for the planned switch.

## Visual parity testing

`tests/test_visual_parity_golden.py` compares the renderer's output against pre-rendered golden
images from `memegen.link` using `imagehash.dhash` Hamming distance (threshold 8 on 256x256). The
suite skips when `/tmp/memegen-upstream/templates` is absent and records distances to
`assets/golden/parity-distances.json`. All 10 representative templates pass under the threshold
after the visual-parity renderer landed
(`docs/plans/2026-05-25-001-feat-visual-parity-renderer-plan.md`).
